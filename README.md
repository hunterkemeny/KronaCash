# KronaCash

KronaCash is a concept app that asks: What is the most efficient way to save money?

The app statically presents a set of businesses along with deals/promotions/rewards associated with those businesses. 
A user can easily find ways to save money at each business and search for deals on specific products. 
To make this application production-ready, there must be a way to access all current deals/promotions/rewards at partnered companies and dynamically import them into the app.
